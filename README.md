EFI/OC/Drivers
- generated by [OpCore-Simplify](https://github.com/lzhoang2801/OpCore-Simplify)

EFI/OC/Kexts<br>
- generated by [OpCore-Simplify](https://github.com/lzhoang2801/OpCore-Simplify)
- RealtekRTL8111.kext (it's my spare adapter, you don't need it.)
- USBPorts.kext from [here](https://github.com/MetalStrikerXLR/Hackintosh-HP-Elitebook-840-G5-Sonoma.git)

EFI/OC/ACPI<br>
- I tried to get them from OpCore-Simplify, but, I didn't have a sys/..../aspi file or anything like that, so I got them from [this](https://github.com/kecinzer/hpelitebook850g5-opencore) (If the previous two methods didn't work, you can generate an ASPI on the target device using [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime))

Errors:<br>
â€” BIOS error 005 (loss of real time clock power); this error is related to the configuration file, I have a [solution](https://github.com/AI-paca/HP-EliteBook-840-G5-Sequoia/commit/ad67879db6f610d0a522bfd27727b328cd686e63) - [config_without_bios_005_error.plist](https://github.com/AI-paca/HP-EliteBook-840-G5-Sequoia/blob/main/EFI/OC/config_without_bios_005_error.plist) but... I'm too lazy to reinstall the system, so I'll keep both files here.

NB:<br>
- don't forget to be careful with [platform info](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/kaby-lake.html#platforminfo)
- use the space bar in the loader if you don't see something

<br>P.S. I will add the fixed EFI working for my screen in another thread. There I'm also going to change PNLF for my screen, mark the fn keys a bit differently (probably they are no longer detected correctly in all systems after the next bios update). How to fix the camera doesn't bother me yet, microphone, sound and bluetooth work, that's enough for me (I'll try to fix it, but no promises). I will also try to upgrade to 4.1 and will report here about the results.
